# 📊 **Customer Churn Analytics**

### **Abstract**
In the competitive landscape of telecommunications, 📉 **customer churn** poses a significant challenge, impacting revenue and market share. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns within a telecom company to understand the underlying factors contributing to customer attrition. By leveraging historical customer data—such as demographics, service usage metrics, and interaction logs—we identify key drivers of churn, including **service dissatisfaction**, **pricing strategies**, **contract terms**, and **customer support effectiveness**.

### **🚩 Problem Statement**
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers switch service providers or cancel their subscriptions. The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns and identify the factors contributing to churn. This analysis will help develop strategies to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.

### **📚 Project Description**
This project utilizes a telecom dataset, providing information about customer **demographics**, **accounting details**, and **services used**. The dataset also includes a churn indicator showing whether a customer has left the service. The main objective is to find out the reasons for **call drops** and **voice connectivity issues** while building a classification model to predict potential churn.

### **🎯 Desired Outcome**
The goal is to build a predictive model that can **anticipate customer churn**, allowing the company to proactively address issues and retain customers. 🛠️

### **🧠 Algorithms**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **AdaBoost Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

### **📊 About the Data**
The dataset is divided into three categories:

#### **1. Demographic Information**
- **gender**: Whether the customer is male or female.
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).

#### **2. Customer Accounting Information**
- **Contract**: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
- **MonthlyCharges**: The monthly amount charged to the customer.
- **TotalCharges**: The total amount charged to the customer.
- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- **PaymentMethod**: Customer's payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Auto credit card).

#### **3. Service Information**
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple phone lines (Yes/No, No phone service).
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, No).
- **OnlineSecurity**: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No, No internet service).
- **OnlineBackup**: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No, No internet service).
- **DeviceProtection**: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No, No internet service).
- **TechSupport**: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No, No internet service).
- **StreamingTV**: Whether the customer has streaming TV service (Yes/No, No internet service).
- **StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer has streaming movie services (Yes/No, No internet service).
